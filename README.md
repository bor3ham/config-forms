# Config Forms

Config Forms allows you to write JSON based form definitions that can be rendered on multiple
platforms.

The form syntax supports advanced features such as layout blocks and repeating sub-forms within your
top level form.

You can also extend the functionality of Config Forms with your own custom fields or layout types.
